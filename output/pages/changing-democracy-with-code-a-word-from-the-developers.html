		<h2>Why we citizens need Memopol.</h2>
<h3>A simple observation</h3>
<p>It all starts with a simple observation:</p>
<p>During an election, when you have the possibility to vote to choose your
new representative, most of the time the elements that can help you make
a choice are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the representative's party's program</li>
<li>their communication campaign</li>
<li>the promises they made</li>
<li>your historical attachment for the representative's party or for the
    candidate</li>
<li>the vibe you have for a candidate</li>
<li>maybe some analysis published in the press or on TV that barely gave
    you any comprehensive / understandable information and is most of
    the time biased…</li>
<li>and sometimes, you might even remember a few thingsthey've done</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds fine?</p>
<p>Well in fact, if we take a closer look at it, we see that there is
nearly nothing concrete (/rational) in this. Nearly all those elements
are emotional.</p>
<p>Don't you find this annoying?</p>
<p>Let me rephrase it: <em>when you vote for a representative, your choice
nearly never (hardly ever) relies on anything concrete</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the time, nobody will do intensive research to see what
those elected representatives have actually done in their political
carrier before they decide to vote for them. This just takes too much
time and involvement, and it's really complicated to do.</p>
<h3>Two worlds</h3>
<p>And if we take a look at the global picture, we see that we have two
worlds: the political world and the citizen world, our world. They
barely talk to each other and they hardly understand each other.</p>
<p>This lead to the unpleasant consequences that we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>most of the time we blame the political world for being totally
    disconnected from our reality and it's hard for us to pass a message
    or a recommendation to their world, we feel that most of the time we
    aren't being listened to.</li>
<li>on the other hand those representatives are nearly never gratified
    or sanctioned when listening to us or actually representing us,
    since we don't use that information when we choose who to vote for.
    So they don't have incentive to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>This situation is barely acceptable. Let's be proactive citizens: how
can we try to improve this?</p>
<p>Well, let's start by simplifying this a bit: we can identify two
important causes of the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our memory, as in “the human memory is really bad, we are barely
    capable of remembering what we ate 3 weeks ago”. How can we expect
    to remember what an elected representative did during the past
    several years?Assuming we were even aware of what they did.</li>
<li>The complexity of the system, as in “the political system is
    horribly complex, it's hard for a citizen to really understand it”.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Magic box</h3>
<p>From a programmer's point of view, the memory part isn't very hard to
solve. It's a very common task: collect data, store data, display data
and gather user input. It's not specifically hard nor easy, it just
takes time to code. In fact, a lot of people have already done this. So,
let's say that we have coded it, and let's call it our magic box.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/magicalbox.png"><img alt="magicalbox" src="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/magicalbox-300x225.png" title="magicalbox" /></a></p>
<p>Our magic box contains all the data we have been able to gather on our
elected representatives, like their public information (contact
information, mandate, party, group etc...), their public speeches, their
votes, the amendments they tabled, etc...</p>
<p>Now, let's use our magical box. We are asked to choose between several
candidates, so let's ask our box to tell us what it knows about them.
Well here's the catch: we end up with a mountain of data that we can
barely understand.</p>
<p>Complexity just hit us.</p>
<p>So how do we solve complexity?</p>
<p>Complexity is annoying because we can't solve it by coding.</p>
<p>But we can use a trick. Maybe, we can't manage this complexity, but, we
know people that we trust and that can solve this complexity for certain
subjects that they've mastered, for which they have expertise. For
example, I trust la Quadrature du Net on Internet Freedom related
subjects.</p>
<p>But how can we use that?</p>
<h3>Solving complexity</h3>
<p>Let's use another trick: let's ask la Quadrature du Net to give us the
best way for an elected representative to vote on texts related to the
subjects la Quadrature du Net have an expertise on. And here the magic
happens: if we combine those voting recommendations with our magical
box, we get a ranking of the elected representatives, organised
according to the ideal behaviour this advocacy group promotes.</p>
<p>This begins to be interesting.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic box + la Quadrature du Net's voting recommendations = semi
    accurate concrete data on who represents me the best</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea? Let's ask all the citizen groups that represent our
interests to do the same.</p>
<p>This gives us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic box + voting recommendation of all citizen groups that
    represent our interests = way more accurate concrete data of who
    represents me the best</li>
</ul>
<p>We just solved complexity.</p>
<p>In fact, what I want to see (and to build) in the future would be a
website that allows me, and every citizen, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a series of representatives I can vote for;</li>
<li>Select a list of citizen groups that I personally trust to represent
    my interests;</li>
<li>Decide if I want to give certain groups more weight to better
    represent my concerns and priorities (we could even imagine giving
    negative weight to citizen groups we dislike);</li>
<li>And have in result concrete data on which I can rely to make my
    choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>And you know what? Being able to do this won't even be the best reward.</p>
<p>The best reward will come when elected representatives start realising
that we actually know what they are doing and that their actions
matters. Guess how they will change their behaviour.</p>
<p>And this is only the beginning. For instance, having a real time feed of
what your elected representative is doing on the subjects that matter
for you will be really easy.</p>
<p>What this magical box is offering you is a paradigm shift, a bridge
between those two worlds for them to better understand each other and to
work together again.</p>
<p>Memopol is the magical box we are building.</p>
<p>It's time for us, citizens, to take back our role in politics.</p>
